# Regression_Project
Using single variable regression and Several Variable Regression to predict the highest point in a country.

The dataset in question contains data from 178 countries. It contains information about the countries,
highest point, lowest point (Minimum.elevation), total area, land area, water area and population circa
2023. Throughout this project our aim will be to construct a model which estimates the highest (denoted
as Maximum.elevation). The data comes from various wikipedia tables and some countries may be excluded
simply for having multiple names. For purposes of this assignment we will assume that the list is complete

1. Single Variable regression: Use single variable regression to predict The height of the highest point in
a country from. In each case discuss the model. How significant is the slope? Does the slope make
intuitive sense? Does it correspond to your intuition from the scatter plot? Discuss how you’d deal
with outliers?

  (a) The country’s total area

  (b) The country’s lowest point

2. Several Variable regression/ Use the techniques of multiple variable regression to fix a model using
some of the variables given. For example, the lowest point, the total area, the land and water area and
the population. Discuss why you left out certain variables and left others in.

3. Overall, if you had to accurately predict the maximum elevation, which model (from the above ones)
would you choose and why?
